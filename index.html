       <h2 class="subheader">About the Project</h2>
       
       <p>The attached documentation which serves as an example for the potential for implementing a discord bot into our servers. The discord bot is a python file that’s connected to the EC2 instance and provides data to users depending on user input in the discord API. This will reduce the engineering team’s workload as currently they are tasks with responding to user input which could be done via bot interaction. This solution can be scaled to various discord servers with custom bot responses built into each server. Additionally, bot commands can be implemented, such as multiple-choice options to further optimize bot responses. </p>

       <h2 class="subheader">Project Challenges</h2>
       
       <p>Some of the challenges with the project involved getting the discord bot to reply to user input. The code worked fine on local machines but had to be revised when connected to the EC2 instance. Also, managing the private token was a challenge, early on I had to regenerate a token because I mistakenly put the file on GitHub publicly. This discord bot has great potential for our company. </p>
